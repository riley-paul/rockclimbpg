The Granodiorite cliffs and boulders overlooking Eaglet Lake at
Giscome possess some of Prince George’s most accessible and
popular climbing and bouldering. At present routes have been
developed at 7 separate cliffs (Dance Park, Roadside Bluff, Eaglet
Bluff, The Far Side, The Further Side, and Giscome II (Giscome West)
in the area with each cliff having its own nature in terms of style of
climbing, isolation, and approach. The style of climbing present at
these cliffs is primarily high angle slabs with several slightly
overhanging jug hauls and crimp fests available to provide variety.
Bring a standard rack for protection as the majority of the routes are
mixed. Extra small stoppers and cams would be beneficial to avoid
long runouts and long slings are very useful at the belays. The
MacGregor Mountains to east, Tabor Mountain to the west, and
surrounding agricultural areas provide a stellar backdrop for the
climbing. Trent Hoover’ s excellent guide to Giscome’s bouldering
(the G boulders) is available at www.drtopo.com. Giscome has
relatively lengthy climbing history (at least for Prince George) with
development beginning in the late 1970 and -early 1980s.
Protection ranges from sport style clip-ups to mixed and traditionally
protected routes.
