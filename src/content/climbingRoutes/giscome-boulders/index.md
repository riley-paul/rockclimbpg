The Giscome Boulders are approximately 30 km east of Prince George, British Columbia. The rock is finely-grained granodiorite, and features an abundance of crisp edges. While there are about 25 sport and trad routes in the area (from 5.7 to .12c), you may find the 50+ boulder problems (V0 to V9/10) to be more entertaining. The problems, most of which are found in the huge talus field, are of generally high quality. The Giscome Boulders have a surprisingly long season; they can be dry enough to climb on in March, and desperate boulderers have been known to drag a pad out to the boulders even after the snow has flown in November. The area can be roughly divided into three main areas; the Poultry Boulder Area, the Hideaway Area, and the Alley Area, where the bulk of the problems are found. To get to Giscome, drive east of Prince George on Highway 16, then turn north on Highway 93. Drive about halfway down the northwest shore of Eaglet Lake; the boulderfield will be on your left.
