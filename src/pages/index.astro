        <CardDescription className="">
          RockClimbPG is intended to provide climbing information for those
          wanting to climb in the Prince George, BC area. This is a collection
          of information developed by various climbers from our community. These
          areas are chosen because of their popularity and accessibility. The
          website will be updated as more information is gathered, so don't
          think what's here is all there is.
          <br /><br />
           The hope is to eventually make a rock climbing guide, but for now
          this will help get you climbing!
          <br /><br />
           Many thanks to everyone who has contributed to this site!
