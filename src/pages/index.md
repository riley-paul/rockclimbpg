RockClimbPG is intended to provide climbing information for those wanting
to climb in the Prince George, BC area. This is a collection of information developed by various climbers from our community. These areas are chosen because of their popularity and accessibility. The website will be updated as more information is gathered, so don't think what's here is all there is. The hope is to eventually make a rock climbing guide, but for now this will help get you climbing!
